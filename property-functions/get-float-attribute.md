# Get Float Attribute

**Plugin:** StateTreeToolsGameplayAbilitySystem
**Category:** Gameplay Attributes

Returns the current (modified) value of a Gameplay Attribute on an actor's Ability System Component. This is the value after all active gameplay effects and modifiers have been applied. Use this to read the live state of any float attribute — such as Health, Stamina, or MovementSpeed — and feed it into StateTree bindings or transition conditions.
