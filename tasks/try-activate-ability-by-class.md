# Try Activate Ability By Class

**Plugin:** StateTreeToolsGameplayAbilitySystem
**Category:** Abilities

Activates a gameplay ability by class on the bound actor's Ability System Component and keeps the task running until that specific ability instance ends. The task handles both `InstancedPerActor` and `InstancedPerExecution` instancing policies correctly. `NonInstanced` abilities (deprecated since UE 5.5) are not supported and will cause the task to fail with an error.

## Configuration

### Actor *(input)*
Bind this to the actor whose Ability System Component should activate the ability.

### Ability Class
The `UGameplayAbility` subclass to activate.

### Allow Remote Activation
When enabled the activation request is also forwarded to remote clients (non-authority). Default is `true`.

### Use Timeout
When enabled the task automatically fails after **Timeout Seconds** if the ability has not ended on its own. Default is `false`.

### Timeout Seconds
The maximum time to wait for the ability to end, in seconds. Only active when **Use Timeout** is enabled. Default is `10.0`.

### Cancellation Means Failure
When enabled the task completes with **Failed** status if the ability is cancelled rather than completing normally. Default is `false`.

### Cancel Ability On Exit
When enabled the task cancels the tracked ability instance when the state exits before the ability ends (for example due to a higher-priority transition). Default is `false`.

## Unreal Engine Version Notes

> ⚠️ **Recompile required when switching engine versions.** This task's tick behaviour differs between UE 5.5 and 5.6. Any StateTree containing Try Activate Ability By Class must be recompiled in the target engine version for it to complete correctly.

### UE 5.6 and later
- Task completes asynchronously the instant the ability ends — no per-frame tick is needed.
- The `OnAbilityEnded` callback fires and immediately signals task completion via the async execution context.
- The timeout timer (when enabled) also uses the async execution context to complete immediately.

### UE 5.5
- Task completes via a per-frame tick that polls a shared result flag set by the `OnAbilityEnded` callback or the timeout timer. There is a one-frame delay between the ability ending and the task completing.

## Error Handling

If the actor has no Ability System Component, the ability class is invalid, or the ability uses the `NonInstanced` policy, the task will fail. You can control whether a failure causes the task to return **Failed** or **Succeeded** using the **Error Means Failure** option inherited from `FStateTreeTools_TaskCommon`.
