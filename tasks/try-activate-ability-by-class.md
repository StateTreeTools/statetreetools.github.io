# Try Activate Ability By Class

**Plugin:** StateTreeToolsGameplayAbilitySystem
**Category:** Abilities

Activates a gameplay ability by class on the bound actor's Ability System Component and keeps the task running until that specific ability instance ends. The task handles both `InstancedPerActor` and `InstancedPerExecution` instancing policies correctly. `NonInstanced` abilities (deprecated since UE 5.5) are not supported and will cause the task to fail with an error.

## Configuration

### Actor *(input)*
Bind this to the actor whose Ability System Component should activate the ability.

### Ability Class
The `UGameplayAbility` subclass to activate.

### Allow Remote Activation
When enabled the activation request is also forwarded to remote clients (non-authority). Default is `true`.

### Use Timeout
When enabled the task automatically fails after **Timeout Seconds** if the ability has not ended on its own. Default is `false`.

### Timeout Seconds
The maximum time to wait for the ability to end, in seconds. Only active when **Use Timeout** is enabled. Default is `10.0`.

### Cancellation Means Failure
When enabled the task completes with **Failed** status if the ability is cancelled rather than completing normally. Default is `false`.

### Cancel Ability On Exit
When enabled the task cancels the tracked ability instance when the state exits before the ability ends (for example due to a higher-priority transition). Default is `false`.

## Error Handling

If the actor has no Ability System Component, the ability class is invalid, or the ability uses the `NonInstanced` policy, the task will fail. You can control whether a failure causes the task to return **Failed** or **Succeeded** using the **Error Means Failure** option inherited from `FStateTreeTools_TaskCommon`.
