# Spawn System at Location

**Plugin:** StateTreeToolsCore
**Category:** Niagara

Spawns a Niagara particle system at a world-space location when the state is entered. The task remains running until the system finishes on its own, then succeeds. On state exit the system is either destroyed immediately or deactivated (letting existing particles linger) depending on the **Destroy On Exit** setting. The spawned component is written to the **Spawned Niagara Component** output.

## Configuration

### System Template
The `UNiagaraSystem` asset to spawn.

### Location
The world-space position at which the system is spawned.

### Rotation
The initial world-space rotation of the spawned system.

### Scale
The world-space scale of the spawned system. Default is `(1, 1, 1)`.

### Auto Destroy
When enabled the Niagara component destroys itself after the simulation ends. Default is `true`.

### Auto Activate
When enabled the system activates immediately on spawn. Default is `true`.

### Pooling Method
Controls whether and how the Niagara Component Pool is used for this spawn. Default is `None` (no pooling).

### Pre Cull Check
When enabled the engine performs a pre-cull visibility check before spawning. Default is `true`.

### Destroy On Exit
When enabled the system is destroyed immediately when the state exits, killing all existing particles at once. When disabled the system is deactivated and existing particles are allowed to linger until they die naturally. Default is `false`.

### Spawned Niagara Component *(output)*
Receives the `UNiagaraComponent` that was created. Bind downstream tasks or conditions to this output to control or query the running system.

## Unreal Engine Version Notes

### UE 5.6 and later
- Task completes asynchronously the instant the Niagara system finishes — no per-frame tick is needed.
- The `OnSystemFinished` callback fires and immediately signals task completion via the async execution context.
- Any StateTree compiled in UE 5.5 must be recompiled after upgrading to 5.6 for correct behaviour.

### UE 5.5
- Task completes via a per-frame tick that polls a shared completion flag set by the `OnSystemFinished` callback. There is a one-frame delay between the system finishing and the task completing.
- Any StateTree compiled in UE 5.6 must be recompiled after downgrading to 5.5 for correct behaviour.

## Error Handling

If the System Template is not set the task will fail at compile time. The task inherits **Error Means Failure** from `FStateTreeTools_TaskCommon`.
