# Spawn Sound 2D

**Plugin:** StateTreeToolsCore
**Category:** Audio

Spawns a non-spatialized 2D audio component and keeps the task running until the sound finishes naturally, at which point the task succeeds. If the state exits before the sound ends the audio component is stopped and destroyed. The spawned component is written to the **Spawned Sound Component** output so other tasks or conditions can reference it.

## Configuration

### Sound
The sound asset to play.

### Sound Concurrency *(optional)*
A concurrency settings asset that controls how this sound behaves when multiple instances are requested. Leave empty to use the sound's default concurrency rules.

### Volume Multiplier
Scales the sound's base volume. Default is `1.0`.

### Pitch Multiplier
Scales the sound's base pitch. Default is `1.0`.

### Start Time
Playback start offset in seconds. Default is `0.0`.

### Persist Across Level Transition
When enabled the audio component is not destroyed when the level changes. Default is `false`.

### Auto Destroy
When enabled the audio component destroys itself after playback ends. Default is `true`.

### Spawned Sound Component *(output)*
Receives the `UAudioComponent` that was created. Bind downstream tasks or conditions to this output to control or query the playing sound.

## Error Handling

If the Sound asset is not set the task will fail at compile time. The task inherits **Error Means Failure** from `FStateTreeTools_TaskCommon`.
